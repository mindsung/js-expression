# json-fx
**json-fx** is a query and transform engine for JavaScript objects or JSON documents.
It defines an intuitive, declarative syntax for expressing an output value as a function of one or more input values.

Templates are parsed and compiled at runtime into expression trees, which are very efficient and lightweight wrappers
around the native JavaScript code they execute. The library includes a large collection of built-in expressions,
and is easily extensible by consumers and by third-party libraries.

The **json-fx** core library, which includes the parser/compiler and built-in expression set, has no external
runtime dependencies, giving it an extremely compact footprint.

## Use cases

**json-fx** may be useful any time a declarative expression syntax is more desirable or practical than
writing imperative JavaScript code for manipulating or extracting elements from JavaScript objects. But it is especially useful
when a dynamic, run-time solution is required for transforming or querying into complex JSON documents,
when itâ€™s not possible or practical to hard-code the logic into your application. For example:


- Templates could be constructed and maintained by an intuitive user interface that would allow application
users to select data elements they want to be extracted from documents and included in reports
- Application developers, or non-programmers who have learned the json-fx expression syntax, could create and
maintain a set of transform templates to map evolving back-end data models to front-end view models,
without requiring frequent changes to code and re-deployment of applications

## A very simple example

Given an input object $:
```json
{ "a": 2, "b": 4 }
```
And a template:
```json
"$.a + $.b"
```
Yields the output:
```json
6
```

## Another simple example

Given an input object $:
```json
{
  "organization": { "name": "ACME Coding", "country": "New Zealand" },
  "people": [
    { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith", "age": 66 },
    { "firstName": "Sue", "lastName": "Smith", "age": 34 }
  ]
}
```
And a template:
```json
{ "retirementAgeEmployees": "$.people:filter($p => $p.age >= 65):length()" }
```
Yields the output:
```json
{ "retirementAgeEmployees": 1 }
```
Or a template:
```json
{
  "@mappedPerson($p)": {
    "name": "$p.firstName + ' ' + $p.lastName",
    "countryOfEmployment": "$.organization.country",
    "canRetire": "$p.age >= 65"
  },
  "peopleAnotherWay": "$.people:map(@mappedPerson)"
}
```
Yields the output:
```json
{
  "peopleAnotherWay":  [
    { "name": "John Smith", "countryOfEmployment": "New Zealand", "canRetire": true },
    { "name": "Sue Smith", "countryOfEmployment": "New Zealand", "canRetire": false }
  ]
}
```
