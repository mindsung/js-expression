## Note
If you've found this package, note that it is very early in development.
It is currently useful, but is not well documented and needs a lot of clean-up.
We needed to get this published for use outside our organization, but it is not yet ready for prime-time.
Thanks for your understanding :)

# JSON-fx
**JSON-fx** is a query and transform engine for JavaScript objects.
It defines an intuitive, declarative syntax for expressing an output value as a function of one or more input values.

Templates are parsed and compiled at runtime into expression trees, which are very efficient and lightweight wrappers
around the native JavaScript code they execute. The library includes a large collection of built-in expressions,
and is easily extensible.

The **JSON-fx** core library, which includes the parser/compiler and built-in expression set, has no external
runtime dependencies, giving it an extremely compact footprint.

## Use cases

**JSON-fx** may be useful any time a declarative expression syntax is more desirable or practical than
writing imperative JavaScript code for manipulating or extracting elements from JavaScript objects. But it is especially useful
when a dynamic, run-time solution is required for transforming or querying complex JSON documents,
when itâ€™s not possible or practical to hard-code the logic into your application.

## A very simple example

Given an input object $:
```json
{ "a": 2, "b": 4 }
```
And a template:
```json
"$.a + $.b"
```
Yields the output:
```json
6
```

## Another simple example

Given an input object $:
```json
{
  "organization": { "name": "ACME Coding", "country": "New Zealand" },
  "people": [
    { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith", "age": 66 },
    { "firstName": "Sue", "lastName": "Smith", "age": 34 }
  ]
}
```
And a template:
```json
{ "retirementAgeEmployees": "$.people:filter($p => $p.age >= 65):length()" }
```
Yields the output:
```json
{ "retirementAgeEmployees": 1 }
```
Or a template:
```json
{
  "@mappedPerson($p)": {
    "name": "$p.firstName + ' ' + $p.lastName",
    "countryOfEmployment": "$.organization.country",
    "canRetire": "$p.age >= 65"
  },
  "peopleAnotherWay": "$.people:map(@mappedPerson)"
}
```
Yields the output:
```json
{
  "peopleAnotherWay":  [
    { "name": "John Smith", "countryOfEmployment": "New Zealand", "canRetire": true },
    { "name": "Sue Smith", "countryOfEmployment": "New Zealand", "canRetire": false }
  ]
}
```
